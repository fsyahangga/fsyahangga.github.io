    <h2>👨‍💻 About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Experienced ERP Technical Consultant with 8+ years implementing and customizing ERP systems like Dynamics 365 BC, AX, Odoo, and SAP. Passionate about solving complex business processes through smart automation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I’ve been diving deep into Business Central — building custom extensions, integrating third-party apps, and guiding clients through both cloud and on-prem deployments. I’ve worked across modules from Purchasing, Sales, Jobs, to General Ledger, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to turn fragmented workflows into efficient, automated processes.
      But beyond the systems and code, I hold tight to three core values: ownership, adaptability, and human-first design. I believe ERP systems should empower teams, not overwhelm them.
      If you’re exploring Business Central, stuck on a process, or simply want to trade notes on ERP challenges — I’d love to connect. Let’s solve something together.
      Let’s connect — maybe we can build something better together.
